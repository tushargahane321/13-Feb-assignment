    "Answer: Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Catch the right exceptions: When catching exceptions, it's important to be as specific as possible.Catching a broad exception like Exception can make it difficult to debug issues because it could be caused by any number of things. Instead, catch only the exceptions that you expect to occur in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Use try-except blocks sparingly: While try-except blocks are a powerful tool for handling exceptions, it's important to use them sparingly. In general, you should only use try-except blocks for code that is likely to raise an exception. Code that is not likely to raise an exception should not be included in a try-except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use finally blocks to clean up resources: If your code uses resources like files or network connections, it's important to release those resources when you're done with them. Use a finally block to ensure that the resources are released, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Don't ignore exceptions: It's important to handle exceptions in a meaningful way. Ignoring exceptions and simply printing an error message can make it difficult to diagnose issues. Instead, try to handle the exception in a way that allows the program to recover gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Use context managers: Context managers (with statements) are a powerful tool for managing resources like files or network connections. They ensure that resources are properly released when you're done with them, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Log exceptions: Logging exceptions can be a helpful way to debug issues in production environments. Instead of printing error messages to the console, use a logging library like logging to log exceptions to a file or a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Be consistent: When handling exceptions, it's important to be consistent in your approach. Use the same exception handling pattern throughout your codebase to make it easier to understand and maintain."
